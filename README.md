# LightGBM

This project aims to use Machine Learning methods to predict the Default rate of customers at American Express. The project is from Kaggle platform, which can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/amex-default-prediction.

1. Data Compression: Compress the dataset from 16GB --> 2GB;

2. Exploratory Data Analysis

3. Machine Learning Techniques:

Feature Preprocessing:

Feature Engineering: Aggregate the data from Transaction level --> Customer_ID level(each customer_id has many transactions);
Feature Selection: Reduce the feature set from 940 features to 300 features;
Feature Transformation: Imputing and Encoding
Model Training:

Trained LightGBM using Bayesian Optimization method;
Model Calibration
The Original dataset can be found in the Kaggle project link, and the Preprocessed dataset(trained on models) can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/christal559/aml4995
